## What’s Special About Our RAT?

- Payload Delivery: Uses legitimate apps to drop the payload, making it impossible for detect.

- Fully Encrypted Communication: fully encrypted connections to the C2C server. Unlike CrsRAT, it does not obfuscate your IP address and port number in simple base64 strings. Our approach makes it impossible to obtain your IP. We use special techniques to properly hide it. Trust me, your C2C IP will not be found in the code after decompiling the APK file.

- Advanced Stealth Techniques: 
Eva*de antivirus detection permanently. Our RAT cannot be detected by any antivirus or VirusTotal scans for a lifetime. Without these protections, any RAT can become detectable within a few weeks or months of distribution.

- Not Affected by Ultra Battery Optimizations: Unlike other RATs, ours isn’t killed by ultra battery-saving modes, boost modes, or booze mode found in Chinese ROMs and others. These ROMs often revoke battery optimization permissions after a reboot or after some time, even if granted earlier.

- Fully Persistent & Undetectable After Installation: Optimized to run using minimal RAM and system resources, it does not send unnecessary connections like CraRAT, which can be flagged by Android devices or raise user suspicion. It always runs calmly in the background, using minimal resources and battery.

- Anti-Emulator and VMware Detection: Our RAT employs a highly specialized and unique method to detect and block emulators and virtual machines. Unlike other RATs that can be bypassed in a few known virtual environments, ours is specially designed to run only on real devices, ensuring it is undetectable and inoperable in any simulated environment. This unique, powerful, proprietary technique guarantees the RAT will run only on real hardware.

- Hij*ck Any Cred*ntials: Access live codes of 2FA authenticators. Special techniques capture 2FA codes when required. Currently supports all known authenticators like Google, Microsoft, 2FAS, and LastPass.

- Freeze Mode: In Freeze Mode, it sends and receives a total of only 1–3MB of data in 24 hours, ensuring an immediate response when commands are sent.

- Portable RAT: No PC required. Control the vict*m’s device using an Android device, Linux, or Windows—only a browser is needed.

- No Port Forwarding Required: Once installed on a victim’s device, you can control the devices (Android 7 - 16) indefinitely.
